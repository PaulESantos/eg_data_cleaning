# Overview

In this workshop you will learn how to import messy data from an Excel spreadsheet, and develop the R skills to turn this mess into tidy data ready for analysis. 

## Learning objectives

* To import Excel files with (common, messy) data problems.

* To address and clean common messy data problems in each variable 

* To address and clean data with more complex meta-problems, like pivoting to long format for data analysis, dealing with multi-column headers, color-coded data (gah!), and un-pivoting pivot tables into tidy data.

## Is this course for me?

If your answer to any of the following questions is "yes", then this is the right workshop for you.

-   Do you frequently receive untidy data for analysis in Excel spreadsheets?

-   Does this drive you slightly batty?

-   Do you want to learn how to make your life easier with a suite of data cleaning tools?

The workshop is designed for those with some experience in R. 
It will be assumed that participants can perform basic data manipulation.
Experience with the {tidyverse} and the `%>%`/`|>` operator is a plus, but not required.

## Prework

This workshop will largely be conducted in the Posit Cloud environment. Please create a login to the Posit Cloud instance of this workshop here:

[Posit Cloud Medical Cleaning Workshop](https://posit.cloud/content/5758558).

If you will not be using the Posit Cloud instance, you can just watch along as the instructors teach.

If you would like to try this out on your own computer, please have the following installed and configured on your machine.

-   Recent version of **R** 

-   Recent version of **RStudio**

-   Recent version of packages used in workshop.

    ```r
    instll_pkgs <- c("tidyverse", "tidyxl", "unpivotr")
    install.packages(instll_pkgs)
    ```
-   Ensure you can knit R markdown documents

- Open RStudio and create a new Rmarkdown document

- Save the document and check you are able to knit it.
