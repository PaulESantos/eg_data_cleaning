# Instructions:

**Recommended:** Complete these exercises in the dedicated Posit Cloud work space, which comes with

1.  all packages pre-installed, and

2.  an Rmarkdown document to fill in.

It will be helpful to peek here to verify that your tables generated in Posit Cloud match the desired output (or even to peek at the Code Solution if your cleaned tables don't look right).

[Click here to enter the R/Medicine Posit cloud work space](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/299322/join?access_code=Vnp96stsVIDLiEJI7AtHAQ4GB1gsptQgnOGb99_N){target="_blank"}

**Otherwise:** Follow along this document, work on your personal computer, and challenge yourself **not to peek** at the code solutions until you have completed the exercise.

# The Data

The data for each section will start out as messy Excel files of the type your well-meaning clinical colleague will have used to collect data from the local electronic medical record (EMR), with typos, data problems, and often untidy data structures.

Essentially, your job is to turn the messy Excel data beast (on the left) into the tidy data on the right.
